## Projects
#### Online Examinaon System | SQL Server & SSIS & SSRS & Power Bi                                
[Link Project](https://github.com/abdelhamedEl3ila/Online-Examination-System-)


The goal of the project is to create an examinaon system that enables students to take their exams which are randomized for each group of students then the system will correct and update their grades automacally. Addionally, use dashboards and reports to analyze this data.  

#### Superstore Dashboard| Tableau &Excel

Led the development of a Sales Dashboard using Power BI, employing Direct Query from SQL Server to ensure real-me data access. Created a robust data model within Power BI to integrate and relate data from mulple sources. The dashboard featured key secons for an overview, sales analysis, and inventory management, designed to enhance decision-making, sales tracking, and inventory management. The project included custom visualizaons, interacve lters, and was opmized for real-me insigh
#### Predicting Used Car Prices using Regression Analysis 
[Python Link Project](https://github.com/abdelhamedEl3ila/car-used-price-prediction-Data-science-project-)

Developed and implemented a robust car price prediction model using Python and advanced machine learning
techniques. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing data to ensure accuracy, exploring correlations between
various features and the final price, and applying feature engineering for optimal model performance. Leveraging a
powerful regression model, specifically Random Forest, the model achieved high accuracy in predicting car prices
